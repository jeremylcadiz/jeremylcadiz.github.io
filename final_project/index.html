    		<p>
				Born and raised in Chicago, I developed a passion for languages, planes, and technology. Years of working in multilingual customer service, international education, and startups have given me a keen sense of empathy and a unique understanding of cultural and linguistic nuances that have helped me solve problems for others. Recently graduated from GA's UX Design Bootcamp, I now work as a freelance UX Researcher in the education space.
